## Dataset

> I used the file 'prosperLoanData.csv' for my analysis. There were 81 columns and not all of them were useful for the data analysis but I left them inplace to maintain the data frame.


## Summary of Findings

> I found credit grade, income range and investors have an affect on borrower's rate. I also discovered that 51.2% of the loans were being used for debt. Next I checked to see if the credit grade and prosper rating were equivalent because the use the same scale. I found that they were not equivalent, prosper makes this rating based on metrics I did not explore.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I added plot titles and made sure legends were legible. I also made sure scales and bins were designed to make the findings easy to read so we can all draw the same conclusions.
